# effective-medium-theory-maxwell-garnett
Solution of Maxwell Garnett effective medium theory. Takes volume fraction and refractive indices of pigment and host as inputs. Gives refractive index of the effective medium as the output

maxwell.m file is a function value. Takes 5 value; 
1-volume fraction
2-real refractive index of pigment 
3-imaginary refractive index of pigment 
4-real refractive index of medium 
5-imaginary refractive index of medium

gives outputs
1-real refractive index of effective medium 
2-imaginary refractive index of effective medium 

You can give the refractive index inputs as vectors or scalers 

Check example file maxwell_example.m for more details.
