maxwell.m file is a function and it takes five inputs; 
1-volume fraction
2-real refractive index of the pigment 
3-imaginary refractive index of the pigment 
4-real refractive index of the medium 
5-imaginary refractive index of the medium

gives two outputs
1-real refractive index of effective medium 
2-imaginary refractive index of effective medium 

You can give the refractive index inputs as vectors or scalers 

Check example file maxwell_example.m for more details.
